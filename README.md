MemEatr
========

Project 2


Once a user is signed up for the MemEatr game, they can play a vertical-scroll game customized with their choice of player and environment, and score points by moving their player around to consume enemy memes. The more games they play, the more types of memes get loaded into their games, and they can keep track of their own high score.
